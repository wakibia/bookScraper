This spider extracts data from http://books.toscrape.com/, which is stable for scraping

We use scrapeops to rotate our proxies although this will never experience any challenges with the serve like being blocked. We also use scrapeops to monitor our spider

You can see the live demo [here](https://scrapeops.io/app/proxy)
Unfortunately we are no longer monitoring the spider, so there are no updates ðŸ˜Ÿ
